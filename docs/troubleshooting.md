# Troubleshooting log

Issues hit and the fix for each. Newest at the bottom.

Format for each entry: **Symptom** · **Cause** · **Fix** · **Commit** · (optional **Pattern**).

When you fix a non-trivial issue, append an entry below. The Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json` reminds about this after any recent commit.

## How to add a new entry

```markdown
## <short title>

- **Symptom**: <literal error message or observable behavior>
- **Cause**: <verified explanation> (or `Hypothesis: ... Verified by: ...`)
- **Fix**: <files/functions changed, mechanism>
- **Commit**: <hash from `git rev-parse HEAD` AFTER committing>
- **Pattern**: <one-line recurring lesson — optional>
```

Concrete only. Numbers, file paths, commit hashes. No "lessons learned" essays.

## Stop hook references a CLAUDE.md that didn't exist (logging system half-wired)

- **Symptom**: The Stop hook references project rules that were not in the repo. `.claude/hooks/stop-check.sh:2` reads `# Project-log Stop hook — see CLAUDE.md "Project log (required, dual-write)".` and every block message emits `Per CLAUDE.md project log rules:`, but:
  ```
  $ test -f CLAUDE.md && echo EXISTS || echo MISSING
  MISSING
  ```
- **Cause**: The bootstrap was run only partially. Installed: `.claude/hooks/stop-check.sh` (v3, exec bit set, 6676 bytes), `.claude/settings.json` (Stop hook wired), `docs/troubleshooting.md` (seed), `content/logs/OverDrive/` (empty dir). The "append CLAUDE.md rule block" step was skipped. Verified by: `find` listing showed no CLAUDE.md, `git status --short` showed `.claude/` and `docs/` untracked, `content/logs/OverDrive` empty.
- **Fix**: Created `CLAUDE.md` with the `"Project log (required, dual-write)"` section the hook names (dual-write spec, .mdx frontmatter template, 7 anti-hallucination rules, visibility defaults, decision tiers, workflow) plus the OVERDRIVE non-negotiables. Added `content/logs/OverDrive/.gitkeep` so the empty dir survives git. Committed the whole scaffold (5 files, 287 insertions).
- **Commit**: 2675f48
- **Pattern**: A Stop hook that names CLAUDE.md is inert/misleading until CLAUDE.md actually exists — when installing the logging system, verify the referenced doc is present, not just the hook + settings.
